# PetsQuotationHackathon
API simplified quotation for pets from a hackathon through SoC.

This hackathon was lots of fun and is something I am keen to continue playing with. As we were limited to four hours of work there are a number of features I'd like to 
add.

Full validation of address and breed type from external APIs
persistent of some form to allow a quote to be revisited for a certain or unlimited time once it has been provided

Possibly explore Grafana and Cloudwatch if possible
